# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this project I will attemp to refactor the code that is given to meet a acceesibility standard and to
make the site more functional so that it could rank better in search engines.

First: I will make sure that the images lets the impaired know what it is they are browsing by adding all
the necessary "alt" tags.
